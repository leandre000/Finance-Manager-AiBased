# üöÄ SET DATABASE_URL NOW - ULTRA CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: I CANNOT DO THIS FOR YOU

As an AI, I **cannot** access your Render account or set environment variables.
**YOU** must do this in Render's web interface.

---

## üìç STEP-BY-STEP (WITH SCREENSHOTS DESCRIPTION)

### STEP 1: Open Render Dashboard
1. Open your browser
2. Go to: **https://dashboard.render.com**
3. You should see your dashboard with your services

### STEP 2: Find Your Web Service
1. Look for a card/box labeled: **`finance-manager-api`**
2. It should show:
   - Type: Web Service
   - Status: Might show "Deploy failed" or "Live" (from previous attempt)
3. **Click** on `finance-manager-api`

### STEP 3: Open Environment Tab
1. You're now on the service details page
2. On the **left sidebar**, you'll see menu items:
   - Overview
   - **Environment** ‚Üê Click this one
   - Logs
   - Shell
   - Settings
3. **Click** on "Environment"

### STEP 4: Find DATABASE_URL
1. You'll see a list of environment variables in a table
2. Each row has:
   - Key (variable name)
   - Value (variable value)
   - Edit button (pencil icon)
   - Delete button (trash icon)
3. **Scroll** or search for the row where Key = **`DATABASE_URL`**

### STEP 5: Edit DATABASE_URL
1. In the `DATABASE_URL` row, **click** the **pencil icon** (Edit button)
2. A text input field will appear
3. **Delete** any existing value (if there is one)
4. **Paste** this EXACT value (copy from below):

```
postgresql://finance_user:1tDohCx2REl9JwPTqHrZJnvI3F08b9W4@dpg-d3jq37vdiees73cnvcqg-a/finance_manager_hyxj
```

5. **Make sure**:
   - No extra spaces at the beginning or end
   - All one line (no line breaks)
   - Starts with `postgresql://`
   - Ends with `/finance_manager_hyxj`

### STEP 6: Save Changes
1. After pasting, look for a **"Save Changes"** button
2. It might be:
   - At the bottom of the page
   - Next to the input field
   - At the top right
3. **Click** "Save Changes"
4. You'll see a confirmation message

### STEP 7: Watch Deployment Start
1. Render will **automatically** start deploying
2. You'll see a notification like:
   - "Deployment started"
   - "Deploying..."
3. The service status will change to "Deploying"

### STEP 8: Watch the Logs
1. Click the **"Logs"** tab (in the left sidebar)
2. You'll see live log output
3. Watch for these messages (in order):

```

==> Using Node.js version 20.x
==> Running build command: npm install && npm run build
    npm install
    added 489 packages in 1m 23s
    
    npm run build
    tsc -p tsconfig.build.json
    Build successful!

==> Running start command: npm run migration:run && npm run start:prod
    typeorm migration:run -d dist/database/data-source.js
    
    query: CREATE TABLE "users" (...)
    query: CREATE TABLE "accounts" (...)
    query: CREATE TABLE "categories" (...)
    ...
    
    Migration SeedDefaultCategories has been executed successfully.
    Migration SeedInitialUser has been executed successfully.
    
    node dist/main.js
    ‚úÖ Finance Manager API running on port 3000
    üåç Environment: production
```

### STEP 9: Verify Success
1. In the "Overview" tab, status should show: **"Live"** (green)
2. You'll see a URL like: `https://finance-manager-api-XXXX.onrender.com`
3. **Copy** that URL - you'll need it for the frontend

## ‚ùå IF YOU SEE ERRORS

### Error: "ENOTFOUND base"
- **Cause:** DATABASE_URL not saved correctly

### Error: "Connection refused"
- **Cause:** Wrong database URL
- **Fix:** Make sure you used Internal Database URL (not External)

### Error: "Password authentication failed"
- **Cause:** Typo in database URL
- **Fix:** Re-copy the URL from this document
